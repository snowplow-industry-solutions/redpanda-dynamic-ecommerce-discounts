A [Snowplow solution accelerator][solution-accelerators] showing how dynamic discounts can be applicable to an ecommerce store. Leveraging Snowplow, Apache Kafka and Redpanda.

Written in Java by our friends at [OSO][oso].

## Quickstart

To easily get started with this accelerator, you only need a browser because **this project can be running entirely in the cloud ðŸ™‚ using a devcontainer inside GitHub (a codespace)**.

So, go ahead and see the instructions for this in the doc [Dynamic Ecommerce Discounts with Redpanda][docs-main].

## Special thanks

This solution accelerator was built by the team at [OSO][oso], the Kafka Experts.
