[[step1]]
== Step 1 -> Start the containers

[,console]
----
$ up.sh
----

[TIP]
.Tips:
====
. You can press kbd:[Ctrl+C] at any time. The docker containers will remain running.
. If there is no file `docker/.env` in the project, this script will try to locate it in a file named `../{project-name}.env` and copy it to `docker/.env`.
This allows you to call `git clean -fdX` at any time you want without losing your configuration.
.. If the file `../{project-name}.env` does not exists, it will copy the file `docker/.env.sample` to `docker/.env` and use it.
. You can pass "services" as an argument option to this script. It will list the options you can pass to it by adding the suffix "-services":
+
[,console]
----
$ up.sh services
apps
discounts-processor
ecommerce-nextjs
localstack
redpanda
snowplow
----
+
. By adding the "-services" to one of the options listed above, you will start only the services listed in the file `compose.<service>.yaml`.
So, this will start only the redpanda services (services listed in `compose.redpanda.yaml`):
+
[,console]
----
$ up.sh redpanda-services
----
+
. You can also call the script `up.sh` by using the `compose.sh` script this way:
+
[,console]
----
$ compose.sh up
----
+
. Finally, *_if you can don't want to use this script, you can change your current directory to `docker` and use the `docker` commands you already know_*.

[[step2]]
== Step 2 -> Know the URL provided by the services

. *LocalStack*: https://app.localstack.cloud <- [[localstack]] localstack
. *Redpanda*: 
.. *Internal (docker containers access)* http://localhost:9092 <- [[redpanda-internal]] redpanda-internal
.. *Console*: http://localhost:8080 <- [[redpanda-console]] redpanda-console
... User / password: jane / some-other-secret-password
. *Ecommerce store*: http://localhost:3000 <- [[ecommerce-store]] ecommerce-store
.. It connects with *Snowplow collector* configured to run in http://localhost:9090 <- [[snowplow-collector]] snowplow-collector

[[step3]]
== Step 3 -> Browse the application pages
:uri-page-view-event: https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/sources/trackers/javascript-trackers/web-tracker/tracking-events/page-views/
:uri-product-view-event: https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/sources/trackers/javascript-trackers/web-tracker/tracking-events/ecommerce/?platform=browser#product-view
:uri-internal-promotion-view-event: https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/sources/trackers/javascript-trackers/web-tracker/tracking-events/ecommerce/?platform=browser#promotion-view
:uri-internal-promotion-click-event: https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/sources/trackers/javascript-trackers/web-tracker/tracking-events/ecommerce/?platform=browser#promotion-click
:uri-product-list-view-event: https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/sources/trackers/javascript-trackers/web-tracker/tracking-events/ecommerce/?platform=browser#product-list-view
:uri-product-list-click-event: https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/sources/trackers/javascript-trackers/web-tracker/tracking-events/ecommerce/?platform=browser#product-list-click
:uri-add-to-cart-event: https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/sources/trackers/javascript-trackers/web-tracker/tracking-events/ecommerce/?platform=browser#add-to-cart
:uri-checkout-step-event: https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/sources/trackers/javascript-trackers/web-tracker/tracking-events/ecommerce/?platform=browser#checkout-step
:uri-transaction-event: https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/sources/trackers/javascript-trackers/web-tracker/tracking-events/ecommerce/?platform=browser#transaction
:uri-enriched-tsv-format: https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/fundamentals/canonical-event/understanding-the-enriched-tsv-format/
:uri-raw-messages-dir: {uri-project-github}/tree/main/scripts/raw-messages.sample
:uri-images-dir: {uri-project-github}/tree/main/docs/main/images

As expected, in the <<ecommerce-store>>, during every page navigation, we are tracking a {uri-page-view-event}[page view] event.

For ecommerce interactions we track the following:

* When a customer goes to a product page we track a {uri-product-view-event}[product view] event.
* When a customer sees an internal promotion list, e.g. Homepage promotions, we track an {uri-internal-promotion-view-event}[internal promotion view] event.
* When a customer clicks an internal promotion, we track an {uri-internal-promotion-click-event}[internal promotion click] event.
* When a customer goes to a product list page, we track a {uri-product-list-view-event}[product list view] event.
* When a customer clicks a product on a product list page, we track a {uri-product-list-click-event}[product list click] event.
* When a customer sees a recommended product list on the product page, we track a {uri-product-list-view-event}[product list view] event.
* When a customer clicks on a recommended product list on the product page, we track a {uri-product-list-click-event}[product list click] event.
* When the customer adds a product to the cart, we track an {uri-add-to-cart-event}[add to cart] event.
* When the customer goes to the cart page we track a {uri-checkout-step-event}[checkout step] event.
* When they go to the payment step, another {uri-checkout-step-event}[checkout step] event is tracked.
* When the customer successfully completes a transaction, we track a {uri-transaction-event}[transaction] event (triggered on the server-side but formulated with the spec of Snowplow ecommerce)

== Step 4 -> Access the redpanda-console and check the generated events

After browsing the [[ecommerce-store]], you can access the [[redpanda-console]] and check the generated events in the topic `snowplow-enriched-good`.

[[stepX]]
== Step N -> (optional) Use {LazyDocker} to monitor the containers and logs

[,console]

$ lazy.sh
