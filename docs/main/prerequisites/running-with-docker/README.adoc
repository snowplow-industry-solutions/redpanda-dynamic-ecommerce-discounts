. Make sure you have this tools installed:
.. {Bash} (version 5.1 or higher). You will run it in a terminal on your macOS, Linux or Windows (in a WSL2 environment).
.. {Git}.
.. {Docker} (with `docker compose` support).
. [[required-tools]] Even though <<docker-doc,you can run most of the demonstrations for this project using Docker Compose (see docker-doc)>>, in a test environment, in development, or to generate the documentation you are reading for this project, you will need to have a few more tools installed. To run some scripts provided by this project you will need some additional tools like {jq}, {yq}, {sponge}, and {docker-asciidoctor-builder}.
. To create a full development environment, you will also need to install:
.. Java 21.
.. Node.js 18.
.. Python 3.12.

TIP: So, here is the best tip to run this project: *it is much more convenient to use {DevContainers} to setup a development environment because, by creating one, you will have all the required tools installed automatically (inside a docker container)*. So, check <<running-with-devcontainer,Running with DevContainers>>.

*You don't need Java or Node.js configured on your machine if you just want to follow the steps to run the project. You only need a Bash terminal, a Docker installation, and some <<required-tools,required tools>>.*
